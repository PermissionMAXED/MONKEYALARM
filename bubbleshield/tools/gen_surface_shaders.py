"""Deterministic generator for the per-effect bubble surface shaders (fx_000..fx_839).

Running `python3 tools/gen_surface_shaders.py` (re)writes ALL of
src/main/resources/assets/bubbleshield/shaders/core/bubble/fx_000.fsh ..
fx_839.fsh, their ShaderInstance program JSONs fx_000.json .. fx_839.json,
plus tools/surface_manifest.json. Regeneration is byte-stable: a fixed global
seed feeds a self-contained splitmix64 PRNG (no reliance on Python's `random`
module internals), iteration is in sorted id order, and floats are formatted
with a fixed precision -- so diffs stay reviewable.

Design (retargeted from the Fabric 26.2 generator; see AGENTS.md):

* W6 RETARGET to Minecraft 1.21.1 / NeoForge (the port target). The 26.2
  RenderPipeline/UBO world does not exist here; every emitted file speaks the
  1.21.1 core-shader dialect instead:
  - `#version 150` (the version every vanilla 1.21.1 core shader uses);
  - the ONLY moj_import is `<fog.glsl>` (linear_fog/fog_distance); the 26.2
    globals/dynamictransforms/projection UBO includes are replaced by the
    plain vanilla auto-filled uniforms `GameTime`, `FogStart`, `FogEnd`,
    `FogColor`, `FogShape` declared per file and listed in the program JSON
    (ShaderInstance.setDefaultUniforms fills them every draw);
  - each fx gets a program JSON `fx_NNN.json` (loaded by `new
    ShaderInstance(provider, id("bubble/fx_NNN"), POSITION_TEX_COLOR)`):
    vertex `bubbleshield:bubble/surface` (shared), fragment
    `bubbleshield:bubble/fx_NNN`, samplers [Sampler0], the uniform list above
    plus ModelViewMat/ProjMat -- see program_json();
  - NO SceneCopy on this target (yet): the v8-v10 scene-copy REFRACTION and
    the depth-soft edge fade are replaced by the [layer:glass:beer] alpha
    composite -- the real world shows through the TRANSLUCENT blend instead
    of a refracted scene sample, the Beer-Lambert chord absorption survives
    as the glass tint, and the near-opaque refraction alpha floor becomes a
    translucent glass floor (bodyAlpha floor ~0.34-0.40, ceiling <= 0.95).
    Sampler1/Sampler2 are GONE from every file (validate_shaders.py forbids
    them until a SceneCopy port lands); the texture budget is 7 taps (all
    through atlasTile);
  - fog is applied by the LAST statement `fragColor = linear_fog(color,
    FogShape == 0 ? sphericalVertexDistance : cylindricalVertexDistance,
    FogStart, FogEnd, FogColor);` -- the same shape dispatch vanilla does in
    fog_distance(pos, FogShape), split across the two precomputed varyings.

* Fragment contract (v8, carried over): inputs texCoord0 (RAW [0,1]
  sphere UV), vertexColor (rgb = palette = dominant chroma, a = dissolve; the
  final alpha is clamp(bodyAlpha, 0, aMax) * vertexColor.a with EVERY alpha
  modifier -- emission, v5 back-face densify, ghost thinning, dither, the
  glass alpha floor -- folded into bodyAlpha BEFORE the clamp, so the
  dissolve multiply is the last alpha operation and no path can exceed
  vertexColor.a * aMax), sphericalVertexDistance, cylindricalVertexDistance,
  worldPos (camera-relative world position from surface.vsh: view dir =
  -normalize(worldPos)); out fragColor; animation ONLY via
  `float time = GameTime * 1200.0;` (GameTime spans one day in [0,1) on
  1.21.1 exactly like 26.2, so all day-wrap quantization carries over);
  `discard` when alpha < 0.01.

* Portability/robustness rules baked into every emitted file:
  - `invsmooth(lo, hi, x)` (== 1 - smoothstep(lo, hi, x)) replaces every
    reversed-edge smoothstep(hi, lo, x) call: edge0 >= edge1 is undefined by
    the GLSL spec, and invsmooth is numerically identical on conforming
    drivers.
  - `safeAtan(y, x)` guards the exact-origin case of two-argument atan
    (spiral/kaleido/petal polar frames).

* Seam-safe periodic sampling (the u = 0/1 longitude wrap): fract(texCoord0)
  alone does NOT make hash-noise fields periodic in u, so V1 files showed a
  vertical seam. Every noise/lattice field is now sampled on a wrapping
  lattice: the u axis is scaled by an INTEGER cell count and vnoise / voronoi /
  voronoise / cell hashes wrap their lattice ids with mod(id, period)
  (`cellHash`). fbm2 uses an exact x-lacunarity of 2 with a doubling period
  (per-octave rotation was dropped -- it would mix latitude into longitude and
  break the wrap; the y lacunarity stays a free float for variety). Center-
  based polar families (kaleido/petals/vortex spiral/interference/ringPulse)
  instead build their domain from sin/cos of whole longitude turns or a
  chordal x-distance, which is periodic by construction (noise fed with an
  already-periodic domain needs no lattice wrap and uses a large 64-cell
  no-op period). Sinusoidal gratings (moire/waves/vortex bands) use integer
  longitude harmonics (baseUV.x * 2pi * m). The "rotate" anim mode is emitted
  as a seam-safe shear sway (true domain rotation would break the wrap), and
  "pulse" breathes the y axis only.

* Day-wrap animation continuity: time wraps 1200 -> 0 once per Minecraft day,
  which used to snap every scroll/sin phase. All constant sin/cos speeds are
  quantized so k * 1200 is an integer multiple of 2*pi (quant_sin_speed);
  lattice scroll speeds are quantized so a full day shifts the (wrapping)
  pattern by an integer number of lattice periods (quant_drift); fract-phase
  speeds complete integer cycles per day (quant_fract_speed). Hash-gated
  flicker terms (per-cell twinkle phases, strobe gates, grain reseeds) simply
  re-roll at the wrap, which is indistinguishable from their normal behavior.

* Real depth (v4): the DEEP layer is 3..4 CORRELATED parallax PLANES of ONE
  deep field sampled on the 3D sphere direction. Each plane obeys the real
  parallax law -- farther planes show finer features (per-plane scale
  1 + i*g), move slower (strictly decreasing integer turns/day rotation
  speeds), shift along the silhouette slope (rimDir, from screen-space
  derivatives of the camera-distance varying -- seam-safe by construction),
  and recede toward the palette's dark stop (aerial-perspective per-plane
  tint accumulated into a vec3). v4 composites the planes FRONT-TO-BACK
  with Beer-Lambert transmittance: each plane's density occludes the planes
  behind it (deepTrans *= 1 - absorb * dp), its light lands under the
  REMAINING transmittance into BOTH deepCol (per-plane color: baseCol in
  front receding through secCol to deepStop) and the deep OPACITY term
  (1 - deepTrans), which feeds the alpha path -- a real volume, not one
  averaged scalar. The deep volume is composited UNDER the MID signature
  (rgb = mix(deepCol, structure, midWeight)). The rim estimator normalizes fwidth(sphericalVertexDistance)
  by the distance itself (view-consistent width) and is split into TWO
  bands: a wide soft inner glow plus a thin hot line at the very edge, with
  a bounded two-band thin-film RGB dispersion multiplied into the
  palette-driven rgb (recolor-safe).

* 3D sphere-direction domain (v3): `sdir` is reconstructed from texCoord0
  (u -> longitude angle, v -> latitude angle), so any field sampled on it is
  periodic across the u = 0/1 seam AND uniform at the poles by construction
  -- no lattice wrap needed. hash31/hash33/vnoise3/fbm3/voro3/caustic3
  sample this domain. The whole DEEP volume lives there, as does the MID
  layer of the unstructured-noise families (FAMILIES_3D_MID: PLASMA, ARCS,
  LIGHTNING, CURLSMOKE, RIDGED, NEBULA), which also gain TRUE 3D rotation:
  rotA() spins the domain around a baked unit axis at an integer number of
  turns per day (day-wrap safe; linear lattice drift is NOT day-safe on an
  unwrapped 3D lattice, so 3D animation uses rotation + quantized sin sway
  only). Lattice/polar families keep their proven seam-safe 2D domains.

* Rich color (v4): the flat multiplicative composite (vertexColor.rgb *
  (b0 + b1 * pattern)) washed out to grey, and the v3 white-screen hotStop
  still bled toward pastel. Every shader now grades the pattern through a
  runtime 3-stop gradient derived from vertexColor.rgb:
  deepStop = base*base*dk (darker AND more saturated, stays in-hue),
  hotStop = a LUMA-CAPPED CHROMATIC highlight -- the base is hue-rotated
  (baked angle within +-40 deg), brightened and saturation-lifted, then its
  luma is capped by a baked ceiling so the highlight can NEVER lerp toward
  vec3(1.0). The old additive white highlight is gone; instead hot areas
  run through a hue-preserving SOFT-CLIP (1 - exp(-k * hotStop * x)) so
  crests saturate toward the palette's bright tint, not white. Then a
  FAMILY-TUNED saturation lift (see FAMILY_PRESENCE). Low-pattern areas
  fall to the dark stop + low alpha (darker/transparent, never pale grey).
  The gradient lookup is offset by rim * rk so silhouettes shift toward the
  hot stop (chromatic rim). The owner /color override replaces vertexColor
  wholesale, so the whole gradient re-derives from it: recolor safety is
  preserved. Every file carries the `// [palette:gradient3]` marker.

* Secondary palette (v4): the vertex format is POSITION_TEX_COLOR -- there
  is no spare attribute for a second color, and packing it into UV1 or a
  format change would touch every pipeline. Instead each shader derives
  `secCol` IN-SHADER from vertexColor.rgb via baked constants (hue-rotation
  angle + saturation/value ratios) computed at generation time from the
  registry's authored argbPrimary -> argbSecondary relation. Both colors
  therefore re-derive from the LIVE palette (owner /color override
  included): recolor-safe by construction. secCol tints the far parallax
  planes in every file and gives material roles to LAVAFLOW (crust),
  EMBERSTORM (smoke) and PORTALVOID (void interior).

* Family-tuned presence (v4): final alpha = vertexColor.a * min(aBase +
  aPresence * smoothstep(0.02, 0.30, pattern) + aGain * pattern + aVol *
  (1 - deepTrans), aMax), with aPresence/aGain/aMax (and the saturation
  lift + mid coverage) drawn from PER-FAMILY ranges (FAMILY_PRESENCE):
  pale/airy families (VOLUMECLOUD, CHROME, KALEIDO, NEBULA) get a solid
  floor + raised saturation so the sky never washes them out, while
  sparse-dark families (BIOLUME, STARFIELD, PORTALVOID, ...) keep low
  floors so their darkness reads. The vertexColor.a dissolve near
  whitelisted players still always wins, and discard stays at < 0.01.

* Helper snippet bank (inlined per file, ONLY the helpers a shader uses):
  invsmooth/safeAtan/hash11/hash21/hash22/cellHash, vnoise (quintic fade,
  wrapping), fbm2 (modes standard/ridged/turb, <=6 octaves), warp1/warp2 (iq
  domain warp), curl2, voro2 (F1/F2/exact-border/cell-id, wrapping),
  voronoise, hexDist/hexCoords, triGrid, truchet, polarFold, spiralWarp,
  caustic, thinFilm, accentPalette (iq cosine, baked consts), rimGraze,
  rimLat, sparkle, ringPulse, and the unrolled correlated parallax deep stack.

* 60 MID-layer technique composers keyed by the SurfaceTemplate families:
  the 16 original enum names (PLASMA..LIGHTNING) + THINFILM, CAUSTIC,
  CURLSMOKE, TRUCHET, RIDGED, MOIRE, TRIWEAVE, NEBULA (350 milestone) +
  KALISET, VOLUMECLOUD, CHROME, LAVAFLOW, TENDRILNET, GALAXYSWIRL,
  RIBBONAURORA, FROSTFERN, BIOLUME, HOLOGRID, PORTALVOID, EMBERSTORM,
  SHARDTESS, SACREDGEO, VOIDTENDRIL, CRYSTALREFRACT (420 milestone) +
  the 20 v5 technique families (SPECTRALVEIL..VOIDRIFT, FAMILIES_V5) staged
  for the NEXT catalogue flip: no EffectRegistry row references them yet, so
  they emit no fx_* file today and every pre-v5 file stays byte-identical.

* v5 quality layer (FAMILIES_V5 ONLY -- the gate is what keeps the 420
  existing files byte-stable): gl_FrontFacing back-face densify/dim (the far
  shell dims toward the dark stop and gains alpha), a 3-tap slope-parallax
  resample of the deep field along the silhouette slope, luminance-weighted
  ghost alpha (dark areas thin out, bright features hold), blue-noise-style
  (interleaved gradient noise) alpha dithering scaled by the dissolve, and a
  soft-knee highlight rolloff. Only builtins (gl_FrontFacing, gl_FragCoord)
  -- no new uniforms, no textures; the vertexColor.a dissolve still wins.

* v6 sampled-texture layer (EVERY file; byte-stability of older rounds is
  deliberately given up this round): each shader samples ONE tile of the
  shipped surface atlas (assets/bubbleshield/textures/effect/surface_atlas.png,
  4096x2048 RGBA, an 8x4 grid of 32 SEAMLESS 512px tiles; identifier
  bubbleshield:textures/effect/surface_atlas.png, LINEAR + REPEAT via its
  .mcmeta) through `uniform sampler2D Sampler0`, declared right after the
  moj_imports and bound by ShieldPipelines' SAMPLER0 bind group. Channel
  contract per texel: R = coarse structural layer, G = mid-scale detail,
  B = fine grain, A = EMISSION MASK (glow, NOT transparency). All channels
  are neutral grayscale -- every hue still comes from vertexColor (recolor-
  safe). The tile is picked per FAMILY (FAMILY_TILE, thematic; all 32 tiles
  are used) and sampled from the family's animated/warped `wuv` domain with
  an integer tile-repeat multiplier (u-wrap- and day-wrap-safe: wuv's drift
  is already quantized to integer lattice periods per day and texMul is an
  integer) plus an inset `clamp(fract(...), 0.004, 0.996)` so the lookup can
  never bleed into a neighboring tile. Three contributions, all LIVE paths
  into fragColor (a dead sample would be eliminated and trip the per-pipeline
  "does not use sampler Sampler0" warning x COUNT):
  - `texDetail` (weighted R/G/B mix) modulates + lifts the family's `mid`
    signature ([layer:tex:<tile>] marker) and multiplies the composited body
    rgb, so real multi-scale texture detail reads everywhere;
  - `emit` (atlas.a, scaled by the family's own pattern highlight and a slow
    day-quantized breath -- spatial, never a full-field >3Hz strobe) ADDS a
    bright hue-preserving palette tint (baseCol pushed toward white by a
    bounded baked amount) into rgb ([layer:emit:atlas_a] marker) and feeds
    the alpha, so filament cores / cell edges / cracks / sparkles GLOW;
  - solidity lift: the presence-alpha knobs are raised (a higher no-pattern
    base derived from the family floor, floor +0.14, ceiling +0.06 capped at
    0.97) so the membrane reads SOLID (body alpha ~0.55-0.9 by family) while
    the vertexColor.a dissolve still always wins.

* v5 correctness fixes (also gated to FAMILIES_V5, so pre-v5 bytes never
  change):
  - DAY-WRAP twinkles: hash-picked twinkle RATES like sin(time*(a + b*h))
    are NOT integer multiples of 2*pi/1200, so they snapped at the daily
    1200 -> 0 wrap. In v5 files the hash now picks an INTEGER turns-per-day
    (sin(time * turns * (2*pi/1200)) with turns = floor-of-hash in the old
    rad/s range) and only offsets the phase -- the wrap lands exactly on a
    whole cycle. Applies to the v5 variant of the sparkle helper (the glint
    flourish also switches its time multiplier 1.4 -> 2.0 so the caller
    scaling stays an integer cycle count), GRAVLENS star twinkle and
    VOIDRIFT star twinkle.
  - POLE GUARD: at v = 0/1 EVERY u maps to the same sphere point, so the 13
    v5 families whose MID signature lives on the 2D UV domain (FAMILIES_V5
    minus FAMILIES_3D_MID) pinched into apex starbursts. Each of them now
    fades its longitude-dependent signature (and every longitude-dependent
    post-pass color mix) toward a longitude-independent body level near the
    poles via `poleFade` (latitude smoothstep, baked width); latitude-only
    or view-based terms (rails, sync bands, rim limb) are kept OUTSIDE the
    fade so the caps still read. The 7 sphere-direction v5 families are
    pole-uniform by construction and need no guard.

* Per-id assignment table: EVERY id reads its family from the current
  EffectRegistry.java surface column (parsed at generation time as ground
  truth) -- the registry, not any modulo cycle, decides which family an id
  renders, so adding families can never reassign existing ids. The
  accentPalette base color is likewise sourced from the registry's argbPrimary
  (not random), so accents always lean toward the effect's authored palette.
  Every id gets a distinct (family, warpMode, deepStack, rimStyle, animMode)
  tuple, guaranteed by deterministic probing and re-asserted here and by
  tools/validate_shaders.py.

* Structural depth rule: every file carries the three marker comments
  `// [layer:deep:<mod>]`, `// [layer:mid:<mod>]`, `// [layer:rim:<mod>]`
  (machine-checked by the validator) plus a small "flourish" accent layer and
  a micro-grain detail pass.

* Recolor safety: pattern layers multiply vertexColor.rgb; cosine-palette /
  thin-film accents contribute only through a bounded mix biased toward
  vertexColor.rgb (weight <= 0.45); the final alpha is
  clamp(bodyAlpha, 0, aMax) * vertexColor.a (the dissolve multiply last).

* v7 quality pass (EVERY file):
  - DISSOLVE AUTHORITY: all alpha modifiers (atlas emission's alpha
    contribution, v5 back-face densify, ghost alpha, blue-noise dither) act
    on a BODY alpha that is clamped to the family ceiling and only then
    multiplied by vertexColor.a -- the v6 ordering let the v5 densify/dither
    exceed vertexColor.a * aMax by up to ~44% at low dissolve.
  - ATLAS POLE FADE: texUV is longitude-dependent (and was applied after the
    v5 poleFade), so the tile pinched into an apex rosette at v = 0/1. Every
    atlas influence (mid lift, body grade, emission) now fades to its
    no-atlas value at the caps via atlasPoleW (latitude smoothstep).
  - STROBE-FREE EMISSION (photosensitivity): the emissive add never
    oscillates faster than ~2 Hz. (Superseded by v10: the visible PATTERN
    itself is now strobe-free everywhere, so the v7 emitMid/tuv twin
    machinery is gone and the emission drives from `pattern` directly.)
  - WASH GUARD: the emissive gain and the emitCol white-mix both fall off
    with the palette's own luma (computed from the LIVE vertexColor --
    recolor-safe), so bright palettes (CHROME/MOIRE pastels) glow in hue
    instead of blowing to white; the atlas lift into mid is smaller and
    mostly gated through the family's own signature, and the body grade is
    partly pattern-gated -- dark palettes read dark, sparse signatures
    (lightning bolts, embers) stay dominant over the tile texture.
  - STARFIELD TILE REMAP: the near-black point-star tile (index 8) gains a
    texDetail scale+bias and an emission-mask boost for its families;
    GRAVLENS additionally gets a raised presence floor, a near-disabled
    ghost thinning (V5_GHOST_RANGES) and a stronger ring/halo/body so it
    reads as solid as its star siblings.

* v8 REALISM layer (EVERY file; the fx_000 hand-authored POC generalized).
  NOTE (W6 retarget): the REFRACTION and DEPTH-SOFT sub-bullets describe the
  26.2 scene-copy design; on 1.21.1 they are replaced by [layer:glass:beer] +
  [layer:alpha:glassfloor] (see the W6 bullet above) while the fresnel rim,
  fake lighting and flow-map sub-bullets carry over unchanged.
  - REFRACTION: `screenUV = gl_FragCoord.xy / ScreenSize`; the bumped normal
    (see below) rotated into view space by mat3(ModelViewMat) drives a
    screen-space offset that grows at grazing fresnel and falls off with the
    fragment's camera distance (length(worldPos), capped); THREE spread taps
    of Sampler1 give chromatic dispersion; a Sampler2 depth test drops the
    offset when the tap lands on geometry NEARER than the fragment
    (reverse-Z: larger stored depth = closer), so foreground silhouettes
    never smear across the membrane. The refracted scene (palette-tinted
    glass) is the see-through BASE; the family pattern rides on top as the
    ENERGY, weighted by its own brightness + the fresnel rim; the emissive
    glow adds after the composite. Per-family strengths (FAMILY_REALISM):
    glassy families bend hardest with the thinnest energy film, dark/void
    families bend least with deep glass tint, GRAVLENS bends the most.
  - FRESNEL RIM: pow(1 - abs(dot(bumpN, viewV)), rimPow) folds into the rim
    glow (feeding gpos, the rim dispersion mixes AND the alpha) plus a final
    additive fresnel * hotStop -- edges glow, the center stays
    refraction-dominated (the classic force-field look).
  - FAKE LIGHTING: the atlas height gradient (2 extra static taps) tilts the
    analytic sphere normal along its tangent frame (pole-faded: the u
    tangent degenerates at the caps); a FIXED baked world key light drives a
    wrap-diffuse multiplicative grade and a specular lobe added through the
    luma-capped hotStop -- recolor-safe by construction, the membrane reads
    as a lit curved 3D surface.
  - FLOW-MAP ANIMATION: the atlas is sampled TWICE, advected along the curl
    of its own height field at half-cycle-offset fract phases and
    crossfaded by phase distance -- the energy visibly CRAWLS. The phase
    speed completes integer cycles/day (day-wrap-safe) and the flow vector
    is a function of the seam-periodic texUV domain (u = 0/1 safe); the
    flicker anim's domain is itself smooth since v10, so the atlas rides
    the shared wuv domain in every anim mode.
  - DEPTH-SOFT EDGES: bodyAlpha *= smoothstep(0, softDist, sceneViewDist -
    fragViewDist) with both distances linearized from the reverse-Z ProjMat
    (viewDist helper), so the shield melts into terrain instead of a hard
    clip line. Applied together with the refraction alpha floor (what shows
    through must be the REFRACTED copy, so the body runs near-opaque) BEFORE
    the aMax clamp; the vertexColor.a dissolve stays the outermost alpha op.
  - Photosensitivity: the flow crossfade and all lighting terms move on
    slow smooth domains; the emission drive is unchanged (slow breath, no
    >2 Hz full-field oscillation anywhere).

* v9 UNIQUENESS + refraction-consistency pass (EVERY file):
  - EXPANDED ATLAS: the atlas doubles to 32 tiles (8x4 grid of 512px tiles,
    4096x2048; tools/gen_textures.py) and FAMILY_TILE is remapped so no two
    families of the same VISUAL CATEGORY share a tile any more (max two
    families per tile, always cross-category -- FAMILY_CATEGORY, asserted).
    Every family also gets its OWN baked texture-drift vector (direction
    golden-angle-spread by family index, day-quantized speed) so the tile
    detail of two co-tiled families moves differently.
  - PER-EFFECT MOTIF FINGERPRINT ([layer:motif:<class>:<envelope>]): every
    id carries one identifiable moving bright element -- Lissajous tracer
    dots (coprime integer day-frequencies + per-id phase), an N-fold
    rotating sigil ring on a latitude band, longitude/latitude scan bars
    (per-id count + direction), circulating orbit nodes on bobbing
    latitudes, or a pulsing forward-point core with an expanding ping ring
    -- modulated by a per-id emissive envelope (breath / double-pulse /
    heartbeat / sparkle-gate, ALL <= 2 Hz and day-quantized). The (motif
    class, element count, envelope) triple is probed UNIQUE per family
    (build_assignments), recorded in the manifest and re-asserted by
    tools/validate_shaders.py -- two effects of one family now differ in
    structure AND motion, not just hue. Seam-safe (chordal longitude
    distances / integer-N longitude terms), pole-safe (latitude envelopes),
    recolor-safe (motif color = hotStop/secCol mix).
  - CONSISTENT REFRACTION: the per-family refraction minima are raised
    across the board (default 0.45 -> 0.90 base; glassy 1.25+; GRAVLENS
    still highest) AND the screen-space offset gains an atlas-slope term
    (refrOff = (viewN.xy + atlasSlope * slopeK) * amp): at the sphere
    center the view-space normal's xy vanishes, which is exactly why flat
    families (holoparallax) never visibly refracted -- the texture-slope
    term keeps the backdrop wobbling there like real relief glass.

* v10 "real refractive shield" pass (EVERY file). NOTE (W6 retarget): the
  VISIBLE REFRACTION sub-bullet is 26.2 history -- on 1.21.1 the alpha floor
  maps down to the translucent glass floor instead (glass_floor_raw); the
  wash guard and photosensitivity sub-bullets carry over unchanged:
  - VISIBLE REFRACTION: the TRANSLUCENT pipeline computes framebuffer =
    shieldRGB * a + sceneRGB * (1 - a), so the shader's refracted scene
    sample was being RE-BLENDED over the straight background at net
    ~0.70 alpha and the bend washed out. The refraction body-alpha floor
    rises to 0.92-0.97 by family, the final ceiling to <= 0.985, and the
    CPU vertex alpha (ShieldRenderer) to 0.95 at full health -- where
    refraction is active, framebuffer ~= refractedScene and the backdrop
    VISIBLY bends. The energy-overlay base drops so gaps stay glassy;
    dissolve authority is untouched (vertexColor.a stays outermost).
  - FRESNEL RIM: fresGlow/fresRim/energyFres all rise -- edges now clearly
    glow brighter than the refraction-dominated body.
  - NEAR-WHITE WASH GUARD ([layer:wash:high_luma]): washHi =
    smoothstep(0.55, 0.85, baseLuma) cuts the specular add, the emissive
    add + white-mix, the fresnel glow and the energy overlay much harder
    for near-white palettes (chrome/crystal) ONLY, compresses the whole
    energy body pre-clip (near-white crests otherwise all clip to 1.0 and
    flatten into one sheet) and darkens the low-pattern body so structure
    shows; dark palettes are untouched. Recolor-safe: washHi derives from
    the live vertexColor.
  - PATTERN-LEVEL PHOTOSENSITIVITY: every >2 Hz discontinuity in the
    VISIBLE pattern is gone -- LIGHTNING's 3-6 Hz hash gate + 6.4 Hz sin
    strobe became a smooth two-sine surge (<= ~1.8 Hz), HOLOGRID's 6-11 Hz
    and HOLOPARALLAX's 8-14 Hz hash flickers became smooth <= ~1.5 Hz
    sines, the flicker anim's 2-5 Hz hash domain jump became a smooth
    two-sine phase wander (<= ~1.8 Hz), and the micro-grain reseed dropped
    6 Hz -> 2 Hz. The v7 emitMid/tuv strobe-isolation machinery is
    therefore gone (pattern is safe at the source).
  - LIGHTNING LEGIBILITY: sharper bolt cut, halved micro grain and a 0.55
    deep-volume weight so the bolt filaments read instead of a noise ball.
  - MOTIF SALIENCE: envelope floors rise to ~0.45-0.55 (was 0.10-0.15),
    elements grow (sigma 0.050-0.085; wider sigil bands/scan bars/cores)
    and the gain rises to 0.90-1.35 -- the per-id fingerprint stays
    identifiable BETWEEN pulses, still <= 2 Hz.

* v11 VOLUMETRIC THICKNESS pass (EVERY file): the membrane becomes a shell
  with real optical depth instead of an infinitely thin film.
  - TRUE PARALLAX: viewV is hoisted next to sdir and Vt = viewV -
    dot(viewV, sdir) * sdir (the view direction's component tangent to the
    shell) replaces the old screen-space rimDir estimate as the parallax
    direction: par = Vt * parScale (draw index 103, repurposed) -- zero
    shift head-on, maximal at the grazing limb, seam-safe pure 3D geometry.
    Files whose MID layer still consumes the 2D rimDir slope (HOLOPARALLAX,
    DEEPICE) keep those two lines; everywhere else they are gone.
  - CHORD THICKNESS ([layer:thick:chord]): a per-id baked relative shell
    thickness rho (FAMILY_CATEGORY -> GROUP_OF_CATEGORY -> THICK_GROUPS,
    jittered by draw 237) yields the view ray's path length through the
    shell; chordN = min(chord / rho, 3.0) is 1.0 head-on and saturates at
    the limb. chordN thickens the deep pattern toward the silhouette
    (mix(1.0, chordN, THICKPATW) on the deep weight) and drives a
    Beer-Lambert absorption of the refracted scene BEFORE the glass tint
    (refracted *= exp(-k * chordN * (1 - baseCol)): absorption pulls toward
    the live palette's own hue -- recolor-safe).
  - PARALLAX TEXTURE DEPTH ([layer:thick:paratex]): two EXTRA atlas taps at
    texUV +- VtUV * DEPTHSTEP (VtUV = Vt projected on the tangent frame)
    blend into deepTex, which joins the pattern composite under THICKTEXW
    -- the tile detail itself shifts with the view like texture suspended
    INSIDE the glass. CRYSTALREFRACT taps a 2x-coarser texUV * 0.5 domain
    (large internal facets). Texture-tap budget on 1.21.1: 7 (atlas only).
  - INNER FACE ([layer:inner:<recipe>]): the back face composites a
    group-keyed interior recipe (energy -> current, crystalline/geo ->
    scaffold, organic -> fogbank, celestial -> stars) between the
    knee/dither layers and the depth-soft fade: rgb mixes toward an
    ALU-only innerCol (re-using deepField / the paratex taps / hgtC /
    motifM -- NO new texture taps) and bodyAlpha densifies by INNERDENS.
    Inner rotations run 0.8x plane-0 speed via re-rounded integer
    turns/day (>= 1, day-wrap-safe). Five showcase families carry bespoke
    inner branches: LIGHTNING bolt after-glow (0.4x turns), GALAXYSWIRL
    counter-rotated star plane + Gaussian dust lane, VOIDRIFT
    meridian-drifting starfield, CRYSTALREFRACT keyL-lit internal facets,
    LAVAFLOW crust-gated current.
  - DEEP LIVELINESS: plane-0 turns clamp to <= round(0.6 * base_turns)
    (the strictly-decreasing chain still cascades) and the whole deep
    domain breathes: * (1 + 0.010..0.020 * sin(time * qs)), day-quantized.
  - COST CONTRACT (enforced here and by tools/validate_shaders.py
    check_cost_budget, in lock-step): exactly 7 texture taps per file (all
    atlasTile; the 26.2 scene-copy taps are gone on 1.21.1), field-function
    call sites (deepField/fbm2/fbm3/caustic/vnoise3) <= 23, raw line count
    <= 760, and the manifest's thick.inner / costTaps / costField must
    match the emitted file.

* Compile safety: conservative GLSL 150 subset only -- const-bounded for
  loops (fbm <= 6 octaves, parallax <= 4 taps, voronoi 3x3/5x5), no while, no
  switch, no arrays-of-structs, no uniforms beyond the vanilla auto-filled
  set (GameTime/FogStart/FogEnd/FogColor/FogShape) plus the plain
  `uniform sampler2D Sampler0;` declaration (NO layout(binding=...)
  qualifier -- that needs #version 420), exactly seven texture() calls per
  file (all through the atlasTile helper: static center + 2 gradient + 2
  flow phases + 2 v11 deep-parallax taps -- all live into fragColor, so the
  sampler is never silently unused), explicit float literals, every function
  defined before use.
