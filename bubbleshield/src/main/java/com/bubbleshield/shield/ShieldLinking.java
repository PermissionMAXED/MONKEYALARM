	 * {@code distance(center1, center2) < currentRadius1 + currentRadius2}, with each

	 * bubbles. Shape is intentionally ignored: a {@link ShieldShape#DOME} links by its
	 * full sphere radius even though its open underside renders no surface there, so
	 * two domes whose sphere volumes overlap below the center plane still resonate.
	 *
	 * @param origin the shield whose link set is resolved; always part of the result.
