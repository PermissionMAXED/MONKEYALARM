/**
 * Pure shape-aware containment math shared by the barrier, the expel pass and
 * projectile interception, so every server-side check agrees on what "inside the
 * shield" means for each {@link ShieldShape}.
 *
 * <p><b>The load-bearing invariant — every shape is a SUBSET of the closed ball of
 * radius {@code r}:</b> a point inside any shape is always within {@code r} of the
 * center. This is what keeps ALL existing radius-parameterized code correct without
 * modification: the {@code 2r + 8} search AABB in {@code ShieldLogic.serverTick}
 * covers every shape's volume, the barrier pushback to horizontal distance
 * {@code r + PUSHBACK_MARGIN} lands outside every shape (max horizontal half-extent
 * is at most {@code r}, the same guarantee the DOME already relies on), projectile
 * interception via {@link #crossedInto} is shape-generic, and boss-bar membership,
 * crowd counting, resonance overlap and the renderer cull all stay valid.
 * Verified per shape: cylinder rim corner {@code sqrt(0.36 + 0.64) r = r}; cube
 * corner {@code sqrt(3) * r / sqrt(3) = r}; octahedron {@code L2 <= L1 <= r};
 * torus maximum {@code R + a = (0.7 + 0.3) r = r}; pyramid base corner
 * {@code sqrt(0.36 + 0.25 + 0.36) r ~ 0.985 r}; lens equator exactly {@code r}
 * (the oblate norm dominates the Euclidean one); hourglass rim corner
 * {@code sqrt(0.3025 + 0.64) r ~ 0.971 r}; star lobe-tip rim corner
 * {@code sqrt(0.64 + 0.3025) r ~ 0.971 r}. A property gametest
 * ({@code ShapeGameTests.shapeGeometryProperties}) samples every shape so a future
 * shape can never silently break the invariant.
 *
 * <p><b>{@link ShieldShape#RING} is deliberately holey:</b> the center (and the whole
 * vertical axis) is OUTSIDE the shield. Players stand in the hole un-expelled,
 * projectiles flying through the hole are never intercepted (no inward boundary
 * crossing), and the projector block itself is not "inside". This is the ring's
 * documented gameplay identity — gametested, not a bug to fix. The
 * {@link ShieldShape#HOURGLASS} waist is the same kind of documented open region:
 * the two cones taper to a point at the center plane, so everything off-axis near
 * {@code dy = 0} is passable (only the exact axis point is "inside" there).
