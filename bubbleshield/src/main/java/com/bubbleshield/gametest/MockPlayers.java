/**
 * In-level mock ServerPlayers with UNIQUE names for game tests.
 *
 * <p>Vanilla's {@code GameTestHelper.makeMockServerPlayerInLevel()} (deprecated for
 * removal) registers every mock in the PlayerList under the shared name
 * "test-mock-player". The default batch ticks up to 50 tests in parallel, and
 * {@code PlayerList.getPlayerByName} returns the FIRST case-insensitive match, so any
 * name-resolving logic (e.g. whitelist add/remove) could cross-resolve ANOTHER
 * concurrent test's mock and fail intermittently. This helper reproduces the exact
 * vanilla recipe (verified against the 1.21.1 sources: {@code CommonListenerCookie
 * .createInitial(profile, false)}, a SERVERBOUND {@code Connection} wrapped in an
 * {@code EmbeddedChannel}, then {@code PlayerList.placeNewPlayer}) but under a unique
 * per-call name, which eliminates the collision regardless of batch composition.
 *
 * <p>Created players are also tracked per test: a {@link GameTestListener} registered
 * on the running {@link GameTestInfo} sweeps any still-online mock out of the
 * PlayerList when the test ends — passed, failed OR timed out — so no phantom player
 * outlives its test even when an assertion throws before an explicit removal.
 * {@link #removeMockPlayer} stays the preferred in-test cleanup (and is what the
 * sweep falls back to); both paths are idempotent.
 *
 * <p>NeoForge port note: upstream reached the private {@code GameTestHelper.testInfo}
 * through a Fabric mixin accessor; NeoForge 1.21.1 patches that field public, so this
 * port reads it directly and the mod needs no gametest mixin.
